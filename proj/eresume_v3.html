  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  During my final semester at Kansas State University, I learned much about SQL, databases, technical writing, as well as web frameworks like CakePHP and Node Express. I wanted to create a website that properly displays my newly-expanded skill set, and this is the result.
  <h2>Features</h2>
  This website purposefully touches on many different areas of web design, as I intended it to showcase the wide skills I've learned through university and self-study. 
  <h2>Limitations and Future Improvements</h2>
