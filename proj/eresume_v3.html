  <h2 class='proj_long_text_header'>Inspiration</h2>
  During my final semester at Kansas State University, I learned much about SQL, databases, technical writing, as well as web frameworks like CakePHP and Node Express. I wanted to create a website that properly displays my newly-expanded skill set, and this is the result!
  <h2 class='proj_long_text_header'>Features</h2>
  This website purposefully touches on many different areas of web design, as I intended it to showcase the wide skills I've learned through university and self-study.
  There are several major improvements this eResume makes over my previous one.
  <br />
  The largest change undergone is the use of a database to store project information. This ensures that project information is uniform and greatly reduces the amount of time needed to insert another project. By defering project creation to SQL initialization scripts, rather than embedding it in the JavaScript, project data is only loaded when necessary (i.e. a project link is clicked).
  <br />
  In addition, the large project overviews are rendered HTML, rather than as a text string. This allows the use of headers, images, and other inserts that make reading much more palatable.
  By using Handlebars and SASS, project information is cleanly partitioned and easily read. This means easier maintenance of my eResume in the future.
  <br />
  Finally, the design has been updated to be more minimalist, and increase load and run times due to the lack of a Canvas element and other slow features.
  <h2 class='proj_long_text_header'>Future Improvements</h2>
  There is still so much that can be done to improve this website, and I have a lot of additions I would love to implement over time.
  <br />
  The biggest issue that I am cognizant of is the navbars on the project page on smaller viewports. Having two navbars here is necessary; there mst be one for navigating throughout the website, and one for navigating through the projects on the "project" page. On larger screen widths, the former is represented by a standard horizontal navbar, while the latter is a sidebar. On phone and tablet widths, however, these navbars are both horizontal to account for the low screen widths, and this makes the "projects" page look very awkward.
  <br />
  In addition, the site aesthetic is bland as is. This is an entirely subjective matter, of course, but I believe that this site needs color. My first eResume had too much, with a giant animated header taking up too much screen space. My second eResume had a smaller header, but for this eResume, I wanted the header to meld into the body, so that the site doesn't seem so segmented. Color highlights can be added to my name, navbar elements, and other text elements, but I need to figure out both a good color scheme and good places to implement it.
